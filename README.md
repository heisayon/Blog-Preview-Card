### What I learned

I learnt how to use the dropshadow filter property, to create amazing UIs. And how to implement custom fonts using @fontface.



### Useful resources

- [CSS DROP SHADOW](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-create-a-drop-shadow-effect-using-css/) - This helped me with the dropshadow property. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [CSS DROP SHADOW TOOL](https://www.webcode.tools) - Also useful.
